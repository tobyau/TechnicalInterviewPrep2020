# 387. First Unique Character in a String

3 Edge Cases  
- If there are no unique characters return -1 (or anything they want)
- Empty string 
- Spaces in between characters

2 hints  
- try using hash table to keep track of the count 
- iterate through key value pairs to find the unique character 


Solution 

```
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = {};
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in count: 
                count[s[i]] += 1
            else:
                count[s[i]] = 1;
            
        for j in count.keys():
            if count[j] == 1:
                return s.find(j)
    
        return -1
